# Sleep Pattern Analysis with Power BI
A Power BI project analyzing sleep patterns to uncover trends in sleep duration, quality, and daily habits. The dashboard provides insights into average sleep hours, weekly and monthly patterns, and the relationship between bedtime and rest quality. Built with Power BI, Excel to transform raw data into actionable health insights.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sleep data to uncover insights about sleeping patterns, quality, and lifestyle impact. The dashboard helps visualize how factors such as bedtime, wake-up time, and total sleep hours influence overall rest and productivity.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Manually tracked sleep logs.
- Format: Excel/CSV file.  
- Size: ~X records (replace with actual).  
- Contains sleep start time, wake-up time, total hours, and quality ratings.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Excel → Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, irregular formats).  
- Power BI → Data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization.  
- DAX → Custom measures (average sleep hours, sleep debt, weekly KPIs).  

## 🔎 Process
1. Data Cleaning: 
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.  
   - Standardized time formats for bedtime and wake-up time.  
   - Created calculated columns for sleep duration.  

2. Data Analysis:
   - Used Power BI and DAX to calculate averages, trends, and KPIs.  
   - Explored correlations between bedtime, sleep quality, and productivity.  

3. Visualization:  
   - Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
   - Included weekly/monthly patterns, averages, and comparison charts.  

## 📈 Results & Findings
- The average sleep duration was below the recommended 7–8 hours on weekdays.  
- Inconsistent bedtimes were strongly linked with lower sleep quality scores.  
- Sleep debt accumulated during weekdays, with partial recovery on weekends.  
- A trend showed that earlier bedtimes correlated with higher productivity scores.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Maintain consistent bed and wake-up times to improve sleep quality.  
- Aim for 7–8 hours of sleep per night to reduce accumulated sleep debt.  
- Limit late-night activities (screen time, work) to improve rest quality.  
- Monitor sleep patterns over longer periods to validate insights.  


## ⚠️ Limitations
- The dataset was relatively small, which may not fully capture long-term trends.  
- **Self-reported sleep quality can be subjective and less reliable.  
- Does not account for external factors (diet, exercise, stress) that affect sleep.  
- Data cleaning assumptions (e.g., filling missing values) may slightly bias results.
